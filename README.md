# jfx-gardening
In this repository is a simple gardening app creating using JavaFX. There are functions to plant new plants, as well as watering, fertilizing, and harvesting them.

# How does it work?
The user is greeted to an empty table that represents an empty garden. All the functions used to plant, harvest, water, and fertilize are located in the top menu, and are based on user input. Fertilize and water are represented as boolean values. Only if a plant is both watered and fertilized it is ready to harvest.
